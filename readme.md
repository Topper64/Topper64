# Hi!

Long time programmer and Ninja Kiwi fan here. Here's a bit of a summary of
what I'm generally working on. Although most of it is in private repos, or
not even on github.

My main focus at the moment is the ["Advanced Popology"](https://redd.it/atomg3)
series of Reddit posts. Currently, there is just some python code to generate
the posts from data in JSON files, but something much more ambitious is in
progress. Will open up the respository once that's ready (Soonâ„¢).

I have a [website](https://topper64.co.uk), containing some NK information
and tools, and even some (very old, very simple) games. Unfortunately, I used
PHP for the backend, so I would really like to rewrite it in python, and
generally revamp everything. This is ongoing, very gradually.

I also maintain "KiwiBot", the moderation bot for the
[Ninja Kiwi Discord server](https://discord.gg/ninjakiwi), using discord.js.
